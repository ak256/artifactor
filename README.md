# Artifactor

An "artifact" generator. Artifacts are randomly-generated, symmetric, two-color images. Due to their randomly-generated nature, most of them aren't that interesting, but occasionally you can discover some good ones. Here are some examples:

<img src="/images/4.bmp">

<img src="/images/120.bmp">
<img src="/images/208.bmp">
<img src="/images/366.bmp">
<img src="/images/666.bmp">
<img src="/images/911.bmp">
<img src="/images/709.bmp">
<img src="/images/1621.bmp">
