# Artifactor

An "artifact" generator. Artifacts are randomly-generated, symmetric, two-color images. Due to their randomly-generated nature, most of them aren't that interesting, but occasionally you can discover some good ones. Here are some examples:

<img src="/images/1.png"><img src="/images/4.png"><img src="/images/20.png"> <img src="/images/120.png"> <img src="/images/208.png"> <img src="/images/366.png"> <img src="/images/666.png"> <img src="/images/911.png"> <img src="/images/709.png"> <img src="/images/1621.png"> <img src="/images/1663.png">

Idea taken from the game Tea Garden by Youn√®s Rabii (<a href="https://github.com/Pyrofoux">"Pyrofoux"</a>). This implementation is not a game, only a generator (and simple renderer using SDL2). You can browse artifacts (and also find the same ones again using their unique IDs) and save them as images.
